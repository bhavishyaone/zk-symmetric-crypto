# 🔒 Zero-Knowledge Proof Library

Welcome to our library for **zero-knowledge proof circuits** designed for symmetric crypto operations! 🚀 The goal is to allow users to prove they possess the key to a symmetric encrypted message without revealing the key itself.

## 🛠️ Supported Algorithms
We currently support the following algorithms:
- **`chacha20`**
- **`aes-256-ctr`**
- **`aes-128-ctr`**
    - This includes any CTR implementation (e.g., **aes-256-gcm**).
    - ⚠️ Note: This is a work in progress and may be insecure (borrowed implementation from [Electron Labs](https://github.com/Electron-Labs/aes-circom)).

## 🔍 ZK Proof Systems
Our library implements multiple ZK proof systems:
- **[Circom Circuits](/circom/)** backed by `snarkjs` (groth16).
- **[`gnark` Frontend Circuits](/gnark/)** backed by `gnark` (groth16).
- **[`gnark` Frontend Circuits](/expander/)** backed by `expander` (groth16).

All these proof systems can be accessed easily via a single **[JS Package](/js)**. This package provides user-friendly abstract interfaces for generating and verifying proofs.

👉 If you’re just looking to integrate this library into your project, check out the **[JS Package's README](/js/readme.md)**.
